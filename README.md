# Project-Euler
Project Euler solutions written in Python, Matlab, Java, ...

WARNING: I'm using this repo to become familiar with Github. I would advise you to try the Euler problems yourself before peaking into these solutions (where's the fun in that?), or try to come up with a more elegant solution (as some of mine are just plain brute force).
