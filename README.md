# Project-Euler
Project Euler solutions written in Python, Matlab, Java, ...

WARNING: I'm using this repo to become familiar with git. I would advise to try the Euler problem yourself before peaking into these solutions (where's the fun in that?), or try to come up with a more elegant solution (as some of mine are just plain brute force).
